# Topological Saliency Library for Python Using TTK and VTK

This library includes functions that can be used to compute topological saliency for a given surface.
In addition, users can perform clustering and topological simplification based on topological saliency.

Required softwares and packages:
    - TTK (https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html)
    - VTK Python API
    - pygeodesic (https://pypi.org/project/pygeodesic/)
    - multiprocessing
    - potpourri3d (https://github.com/nmwsharp/potpourri3d)
